A Few Last Matchers
Before we wrap up, let me show you a couple of other matchers

obj.should be_true, obj.should be_false, obj.should be_nil, obj.should be_empty - the first three of these could be done by == true, etc. be_empty will be true if obj.empty? is true.
obj.should exist - does this object even exist yet?
obj.should have_at_most(n).items, object.should have_at_least(n).items - like have, but will pass if there are more or fewer than n items, respectively.
obj.should include(a[,b,...]) - are one or more items in an array?
obj.should match(string_or_regex) - does the object match the string or regex?
obj.should raise_exception(error) - does this method raise an error when called?
obj.should respond_to(method_name) - does this object have this method? Can take more than one method name, in either strings or symbols.
